# var-from-scratch
Very chaotic from scratch implementation of the VAR model.

- A few obvious things are still missing from the implementation
    - GAN discriminator loss
    - Appropriate upscaling in the transformer (not interpolation)
- Probably a few mistakes
- Scripts and code to be cleaned up to be config driven
- And don't expect this to work right now
